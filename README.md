## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer  

- This script is intended **for educational and personal use only.** Scraping websites like Amazon may violate their Terms of Service. Always check and comply with the site's terms before using this script.  
- Amazon employs anti-scraping mechanisms, so frequent or large-scale requests may result in IP bans or other restrictions. Consider using proxy servers or rate-limiting techniques if you're performing extensive scraping tasks.  
- This script does not bypass CAPTCHA or other advanced anti-bot systems implemented by Amazon.

## üí° Recommendations  

1. **Use Proxies:** For large-scale scraping, implement proxy rotation to prevent IP bans.  
2. **Rate Limiting:** Add delays between requests to mimic human behavior and reduce the likelihood of being flagged.  
3. **Error Handling:** Enhance the script to handle exceptions like missing data fields or network issues gracefully.  
4. **Dynamic User-Agent:** Use random user-agent strings to minimize detection risk.
